    "# Training PyTorch models on an IPU using Paperspace Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials will show you how to use PyTorch models and train then on a Graphcore IPU using the Paperspace Gradient environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this environment, you will be able to learn how to use an IPU in a Jupyter-style notebook and use it to train large models including BERT-Large for natural language processing and SchNet-GNN to predict molecular energy gaps. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "No user setup is required to train IPU models on Gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, open the `get-started` folder and run `Fine-tuning-BERT.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses the [BERT-Large model](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/pytorch/finetuning_bert) fine-tuned using the SQuAD question answering dataset as an example to show how PyTorch models can be trained with a local dataset on the IPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you can open up the `PyG-SchNetGNN.ipynb` notebook, which will take you through training a model to predict molecular energy gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "More Graphcore IPU examples can be found at their [tutorials](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials/) and [examples](https://github.com/graphcore/examples/) GitHub repositories."
